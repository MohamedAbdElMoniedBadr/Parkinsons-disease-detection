# Parkinson's Disease Detection Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Parkinson's disease detection model using machine learning techniques. The model employs various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The performance of these algorithms is compared to determine the most effective approach for Parkinson's disease detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (sklearn), matplotlib, scipy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MohamedAbdElMoniedBadr/Parkinsons-disease-detection

2. Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib scipy

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project file: project.ipynb

2. Run the script to train and evaluate the model
   
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains observations from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. Prior to model training, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and other preprocessing tasks.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented and compared for Parkinson's disease detection:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

## Performance Comparison

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier emerge as equally effective models for Parkinson's disease detection.
